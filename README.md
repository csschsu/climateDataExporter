<h1>Climate data client</h1>
Read climate sensors ds18b20, DHT22 and bmp280 on arduino
to get temperature, humidity and barometric pressure.
Arduino connects with serial connection to a Raspberry supplies 
prometheus metrics on the configured port. 

<h2> supported sensors </h2>
ds18b20 sensors with onewire on one arduino
bmp280+DHT22 on on one arduino

Current setup are restricted to one arduino at a time.
